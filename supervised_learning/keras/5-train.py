    &function that trains a model using mini-batch gradient descent:

        containing the labels of data
    batch_size is the size of the batch used for mini-batch gradient descent
    epochs is the number of passes through data for mini-batch gradient descent
    verbose is a boolean that determines if output should be printed
    shuffle is a boolean whether to shuffle the batches every epoch.
    validation_data is the data to validate the model with, if not None
